<h2>Installation</h2>

<h2>Post to your blog</h2>

<p>All you need to do to create a new blog post is write and send a new email to the address you specified in installation. The subject of the email is the post title, and the body of the email is the post content. It's that easy!</p>

<h2>Changing Settings</h2>
